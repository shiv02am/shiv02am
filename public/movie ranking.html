    <h3>Leave the world behind </h3>
    <p>There’s no going back to normal in this apocalyptic thriller. Amanda Sandford (Julia Roberts) and her husband, Clay (Ethan Hawke), take their kids on a weekend family getaway to a gorgeous house on Long Island to escape the city buzz. But their vacation bliss is soon interrupted when the homeowner, G.H. Scott (Mahershala Ali), and his daughter, Ruth (Myha’la), arrive in the middle of the night seeking to hunker down in the midst of citywide blackouts in New York City. G.H. believes that the phenomenon might be a sign of something bigger, and the two families must learn to trust each other if they have any hope of surviving. </p>
    <h3>Fair play</h3>
    <p>An ambitious power couple fight their way up the corporate ladder, but can their relationship survive? Emily (Phoebe Dynevor) and Luke (Alden Ehrenreich) are a pair of newly engaged financial analysts whose relationship is forbidden by their mutual employer, cutthroat hedge fund One Crest Capital. When Emily gets an unexpected promotion that Luke expected for himself, power games between the two begin to tear their relationship apart. Only one person can come out on top, even if it ruins their future together.  </p>
    <h3>Reptile </h3>
    <p>In this twisty thriller, hardened detective Tom Nichols (Benicio Del Toro) is thrown into a murder investigation after a young real estate agent is found dead at one of her listings. The young woman’s boyfriend, Will Grady (Justin Timberlake), who’s the head of his family’s real estate empire, is completely devastated by her death, but something is amiss — and Nichols’ investigation into the case leads him to a web of corruption that begins to unravel his whole life. Come for the mystery, stay for Alicia Silverstone’s performance as Tom’s wife, Judy, who is, in some ways, his most trusted partner. </p>
